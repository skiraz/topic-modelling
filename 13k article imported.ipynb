    "          'Oil prices fell on Monday as worries over Chinas economy resurfaced after a survey showing growth in factory activity slipped sharply in the worlds second-largest oil consumer, with concerns compounded by higher crude output from OPEC producers. Brent crude oil futures slid by 79 cents, or 1.06%, to $74.62 a barrel by 0945 GMT, having earlier touched a low of $74.10. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dropped 88 cents, or 1.2%, to $73.07 after slipping to a session low of $72.77. China has been leading economic recovery in Asia and if the pullback deepens, concerns will grow that the global outlook will see a significant decline, said Edward Moya, senior analyst at OANDA.

King Abdullah is the first Arab head of state to visit the White House since Mr. Biden took office, a sign that the United States wants to elevate Jordan once again to its traditional role as a regional peacemaker. We’ve been hanging out together for a long time, Mr. Biden said Monday, as the two sat in the Oval Office ahead of their bilateral meeting. It’s good to have him back in the White House.” Although Mr. Biden’s foreign policy priorities are heavily focused on China and Russia, the Middle East is a region that the new administration quickly learned it cannot afford to ignore',\n",
