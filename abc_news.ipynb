Brent crude oil futures slid by 79 cents, or 1.06%, to $74.62 a barrel by 0945 GMT, having earlier touched a low of $74.10. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dropped 88 cents, or 1.2%, to $73.07 after slipping to a session low of $72.77. China has been leading economic recovery in Asia and if the pullback deepens, concerns will grow that the global outlook will see a significant decline, said Edward Moya, senior analyst at OANDA.

We’ve been hanging out together for a long time, Mr. Biden said Monday, as the two sat in the Oval Office ahead of their bilateral meeting. It’s good to have him back in the White House.” Although Mr. Biden’s foreign policy priorities are heavily focused on China and Russia, the Middle East is a region that the new administration quickly learned it cannot afford to ignore',\n",
